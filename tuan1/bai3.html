        One particular book which is recommended reading is <u>The Street Lawyer</u> by <u>John Grisham</u>. This book
        is
        about a lawyer who begins re-evaluating his priorities in life when a bad

        realizes the harsh existence of the homeless, and vows to give them a chance in the courts. <u>The Street
            Lawyer</u> is a <b><i>great</i></b>

        book. It is <b><i>well written</i></b> and <b><i>interesting</i></b>. Other books by <u>John Grisham</u> include
